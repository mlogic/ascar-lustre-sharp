SHARP is the traffic control rule generator and optimizer for ASCAR,
as described in paper ``ASCAR: Automating Contention Management for
High-Performance Storage Systems'' by Yan Li, Xiaoyuan Lu, Ethan
L. Miller, and Darrell D. E. Long. It is developed by the Storage
Systems Research Center in University of California, Santa Cruz.

The programs here are tightly coupled with our test environment so it
may require modification if you plan to run them in other
settings. Please contact us if you have questions or want to share
your modification for code merge.
